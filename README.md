# numerical

This repository is dedicated to practicing and exploring classic machine learning algorithms in Python. My approach is guided by the principles outlined in the `@education.mdc` rule, which emphasizes:

- Using sklearn for standard implementations of classic algorithms (like PCA, regression, and classification) whenever possible.

- Leveraging numpy for data manipulation and to deepen understanding of algorithmic steps.

- Focusing on learning, experimentation, and step-by-step improvement, rather than just producing final code.

The goal is to remember my machine learning knowledge, with an emphasis on clear understanding the code in the simplest way possible and adaptive, educational progress.

## Algorithms Practiced So Far

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Logit/Logistic Regression

*(This list will grow as I continue learning and experimenting!)*

## How to use

Run `uv sync` to install the dependencies.

Run `uv run python3 src/numerical/<algorithm>.py` to run the algorithm.
